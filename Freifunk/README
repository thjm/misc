- v2016.2.5.patches : patches for Gluon v2016.2.5 to enable the
        generation of the 8 MByte and 16 MByte images for the
        TP_Link TL WR841N/ND V8 .. V12 routers.

  This patch works also with gluon v2016.2.4.

  The patch supports now also TP_Link TL WR841N/ND V12 routers

   https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1093

  Supported models:
   TL WR841N/ND V8 4 (standard), 8 & 16 MByte Flash
   TL WR841N/ND V9 4 (standard), 8 & 16 MByte Flash
   TL WR841N/ND V10 4 (standard), 8 & 16 MByte Flash
   TL WR841N/ND V11 4 (standard), 8 & 16 MByte Flash
   TL WR841N/ND V12 4 (standard), 8 & 16 MByte Flash

  Tested on the following hardware:
   TL WR841N/ND V9 8 MByte (tnx to noku67)
   TL WR841N/ND V11 8 MByte
   TL WR841N/ND V11 16 MByte (tnx to begin)

  The software is provided as it is and there is no warranty
  if you brick your router!

- v2016.2.6.patches : patches for Gluon v2016.2.6 to enable the
        generation of the 8 MByte and 16 MByte images for the
        TP_Link TL WR841N/ND V8 .. V12 routers.

- v2016.2.7.patches  : patches for Gluon v2016.2.7 to enable the
        generation of the 8 MByte and 16 MByte images for the
        TP_Link TL WR841N/ND V8 .. V12 routers.

        This patch is identical to the v2016.2.6.patches file.

- gluon-lede-2017.1.5.*.patch : patches to be used to build
    gluon v2017.1.5 and gluon v2017.1.7

    The build scripts require access to the site-ffka git repository.
    Its URL https://gitlab.ffka.tech/firmware/site is only accessible
    via IPv6.(?)

- gluon-lede-2017.0.0.*.patch : patches to be used with
    build_lede_ffnord.sh script. This will create the large
    images (i.e. 8MB and 16MB) for TL-WR841N/ND routers.

  - gluon-lede-2017.0.0.tl-wr841.patch

  - gluon-lede-2017.0.0.ar7xxx-tiny.patch - large images for
     the ar7xxx-tiny target

  - gluon-lede-2017.0.0.ar7xxx-generic.patch - large images
     for the ar7xxx-generic target

Directory scripts:

- build_ffka_v2017.1.7.sh : script to build gluon v2017.1.7 for
       TL-WR841N/ND for 8MB/16MB based on the above patches

- build_ffka.sh : wip, script to do all the work of building the
       Gluon images, for domain ffka, with 8MB/16MB patches

- modify_uboot.sh : script which merges the saved /dev/mtd0 with
       a new uBoot image and some further addition(s) into
       a new image to be written into /dev/mtd0 then

- create_16mb_image.sh : script to create an image file for a 16 MByte
       flash chip which contains:
       - the modified uBoot
       - the 16MB factory image of your favorite FF community
       - the magic (ID specifier) bytes
       - the valid ART partition (from the old flash)

       At present this seems to work only using the contents readout from
       the old (= de-soldered) 4MB flash chip. The script makes the use of
       other Linux command line tools as well as the TL866 programming
       tool (MiniPro) unnecessary. However you need still a flash programmer
       with appropriate software to read/write the flash chips ;)

       Note: should be easily adoptable to 8MB flash chips!

- build_lede_ffnord.sh : script to build the latest gluon images
       with proper 8MB and 16 MB patches for TL-WR841N models.

       4MB, 8MB and 16MB images can be built for the targets ar71xx-tiny
       and ar71xx-generic, whereas the ar71xx-generic target doesn't
       support 4MB images.

       If the target ar71xx-tiny is build after the ar71xx-generic target
       with all patches enabled then the large images will be overwritten!

       Supported models:
        TL WR841N/ND V8 .. TL WR841N/ND V12

       !!! Not yet tested on real hardware !!!
